      "body": "December 15, 2025 / 5:02 PM EST\n            / CBS News\n\nWashington — President Trump on Monday signed an executive order designating illicit fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, directing the Pentagon and Justice Department to take additional steps to combat production and distribution of the drug and its precursors.\n\nThe executive order casts fentanyl as not just a lethal drug, but as a potential chemical weapon. The White House says the move \"unleashes every tool to combat the cartels and foreign networks responsible for flooding communities with this deadly substance,\" warning that fentanyl could be weaponized for \"concentrated, large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries.\"\n\nThe designation means the Pentagon could aid the Justice Department with Department of Defense assets to enforce the criminal code related to fentanyl, and the Justice Department will likely pursue harsher penalties for fentanyl-related crimes.\n\nThe order comes as the president has said he is preparing to expand the U.S. campaign against alleged drug traffickers in South America, following more than 20 boat strikes against vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. Most of the fentanyl that enters the U.S. is manufactured in Mexico using chemicals primarily imported from China and India. The drug is then smuggled into the U.S., mostly through ports of entry.\n\n\"With this historic executive order ... we're formally classifying as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is,\" the president said at the White House. \"No bomb does what this has done. 200,000 to 300,000 people die every year, that we know of. So we're formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction.\"\n\nFentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 45. The Drug Enforcement Administration says more than 107,000 people died from a drug overdose in the U.S. in 2023, and nearly 70% of those deaths were attributed to opioids like fentanyl.\n\nThe president's executive order describes illicit fentanyl as fentanyl that is manufactured, distributed, dispensed or possessed in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. It makes no mention of fentanyl used legally in medical settings.\n\nThe FBI defines a WMD as a \"destructive device, such as an explosive or incendiary bomb, rocket, or grenade; a weapon that is designed to cause death or serious injury through toxic or poisonous chemical; a weapon that contains a biological agent or toxin;\" or \"a weapon that is designed to release dangerous levels of radiation or radioactivity.\"\n\nSome members of Congress previously sought to classify fentanyl as a WMD.\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "body": "BERLIN (AP) — The U.S. has agreed to provide unspecified security guarantees to Ukraine as part of a peace deal to end Russia’s nearly four-year war, and more talks are likely this weekend, U.S. officials said Monday following the latest discussions with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Berlin.\n\nThe officials said talks with President Donald Trump’s envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, led to narrowing differences on security guarantees that Kyiv said must be provided, as well as on Moscow’s demand that Ukraine concede land in the Donbas region in the country’s east.\n\nTrump dialed into a dinner Monday evening with negotiators and European leaders, and more talks are expected this weekend in Miami or elsewhere in the United States, according to the U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly by the White House.\n\n“I think we’re closer now than we have been, ever,” Trump told reporters at an unrelated White House event. He added, “We’re having tremendous support from European leaders. They want to get it ended, also.”\n\nThe U.S. officials said the offer of security guarantees won’t be on the table “forever.” They said the Trump administration plans to put forward the agreement on guarantees for Senate approval, although they didn’t specify whether it would be ratified like a treaty, which needs the chamber’s two-thirds approval.\n\nIn a statement, European leaders in Berlin said they and the U.S. committed to work together to provide “robust security guarantees,” including a European-led ”multinational force Ukraine” supported by the U.S.\n\nThey said the force’s work would include “operating inside Ukraine” as well as assisting in rebuilding Ukraine’s forces, securing its skies and supporting safer seas. They said Ukrainian forces should remain at a peacetime level of 800,000.\n\nWitkoff and Kushner were accompanied by U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, who heads NATO’s military operations and the U.S. European Command, as talks honed in on the particulars of what the U.S. officials described as an “Article 5-like” security agreement. Article Five in the NATO treaty is the collective defense clause stating that an attack on one member is an attack on all.\n\nThe U.S. side presented the Ukrainians a document that spelled out in greater specificity aspects of the proposed U.S. security guarantees — something that Ukrainian officials said was missing from earlier iterations of the U.S. peace proposal, according to U.S. officials.\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it a “truly far-reaching, substantial agreement that we did not have before, namely that both Europe and the U.S. are jointly prepared to do this.”\n\nQuestions over Ukraine’s postwar security and the fate of occupied territories have been the main obstacles in talks. Zelenskyy has emphasized that any Western security assurances would need to be legally binding and supported by the U.S. Congress. Meanwhile, Russia has said it will not accept any troops from NATO countries being based on Ukrainian soil.\n\nZelenskyy on Monday called the talks “substantial” and noted that differences remain on the issue of territory.\n\nZelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine’s bid to join NATO if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine’s preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.\n\nUkraine has continued to reject the U.S. push for ceding territory to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the part of the Donetsk region still under its control as a key condition for peace.\n\nThe U.S. officials on Monday said there is consensus on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan, and that Russia has indicated it is open to Ukraine joining the European Union, something it previously said it did not object to.\n\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on U.S. officials citing progress in talks with Ukrainian leaders on ending Russia’s war.\n\nThe Russian president has cast Ukraine’s bid to join NATO, however, as a major threat to Moscow’s security and a reason for launching the full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Kremlin has demanded that Ukraine renounce the bid for alliance membership as part of any prospective peace settlement.\n\nAsked whether the negotiations could be over by Christmas, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said trying to predict a potential time frame for a peace deal was a “thankless task.”\n\n“I can only speak for the Russian side, for President Putin,” Peskov said. “He is open to peace, to a serious peace and serious decisions. He is absolutely not open to any tricks aimed at stalling for time.”\n\nPutin has denied plans to attack any European allies.\n\nRussia fired 153 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight Sunday into Monday, according to Ukraine’s Air Force, which said 133 drones were neutralized, while 17 more hit their targets.\n\nIn Russia, the Defense Ministry on Monday said forces destroyed 130 Ukrainian drones overnight. An additional 16 drones were destroyed between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. local time.\n\nEighteen drones were shot down over Moscow itself, the defense ministry said. Flights were temporarily halted at the city’s Domodedovo and Zhukovsky airports as part of safety measures, officials said.\n\nDamage details and casualty figures were not immediately available.\n\n___\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.
